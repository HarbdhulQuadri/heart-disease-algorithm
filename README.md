Prediction Algorithm
The advent of universal health care coverage in the United States and the use of electronic health records can make the medical record a disease surveillance tool. The objective of our study was to identify criteria that accurately categorize acute coronary and heart failure events by using electronic health record data exclusively so that the medical record can be used for surveillance without manual record review.

##METHODS:
We  compared 4 computer algorithms to manual record review.
